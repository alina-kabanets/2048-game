## **2048 Game**

_2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game, developed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project involved creating an interactive 4x4 grid where players slide numbered tiles to combine them, aiming to reach the 2048 tile. This project provided an excellent opportunity to practice core JavaScript concepts, including array manipulation, string methods, DOM manipulation, and event handling, while building a classic, engaging game._

## **Demo**

## 🚀 **Technologies Used:**

- JavaScript:

   - DOM Manipulation: querySelector(), getElementById(), classList, innerText

   - Array Methods: push(), forEach(), filter(), map(), reverse()

   - Math Methods: Math.floor(), Math.random()

   - Event Handling: addEventListener(), removeEventListener()

   - String Methods: parseInt(), toString()

- HTML5: Structured the game grid and interface elements.

- CSS3: Styled the game board and tiles, ensuring a visually consistent and responsive design.


## 🚀 **Key Contributions:**

- 🔥 Game Logic Implementation: Developed the core game mechanics, including tile movement, merging, and random tile generation, using JavaScript. Implemented the sliding and merging logic to ensure tiles move smoothly and correctly within the 4x4 grid.

- ⚡ User Interface: Created a responsive and visually appealing game interface using HTML and CSS. Designed the grid layout and styled tiles to dynamically reflect their numerical values.

- ✨ Event Handling: Implemented keyboard controls for game interaction, capturing arrow key inputs to move tiles. Managed game state updates and user feedback based on player actions.

- 📌 Score Tracking: Developed a scoring system that updates in real-time as players merge tiles, enhancing the game's competitive aspect.

- 🔥 Win/Loss Conditions: Programmed the game to detect win (reaching 2048) and loss (no available moves) conditions, displaying appropriate messages and providing restart functionality.
